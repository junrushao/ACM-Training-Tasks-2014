The House of Doctor Dee</h2><div class="problem_limits">Time limit: 0.5 second<br>Memory limit: 64 MB<br><br></div><div id="problem_text"><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Mr. X is very fond of the novel “The House of Doctor Dee”, which is set in
London in the 16th century and in the end of the 20th century. Rereading the
novel once again, Mr. X decided to draw a map of London with routes of the
protagonists Dr. Dee and Matthew Palmer. Dr.Dee, who lived in the 16th
century, often traveled from  his house to St. Paul's Cathedral, and Matthew,
who lived in the 20th century, regularly walked from the National Gallery to
the British Museum.
</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Every time it turned out that the protagonists were at the same point in
London, Dr. Dee had visions about what was happening to Matthew at that moment.
Such moments were often enough, and Mr. X decided to draw the motion
trajectories of Dr. Dee and Matthew in such a way that their common part be as
long as possible. However, Mr. X is not very good at the topography of London.
He assumes that the city is built by a rectangular scheme—each street
stretches through the whole city either from west to east or from north to
south. The house of Dr. Dee, St. Paul's Cathedral, the National Gallery, and
the British Museum are located exactly at the intersections of two orthogonal
streets. Moreover, Mr. X is sure that Dr. Dee and Matthew always took one of
the shortest possible routes.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Though London is very big, Mr. X has already drawn its map. He has also marked
Dr. Dee's house, St. Paul's Cathedral, the National Gallery, and the British
Museum on the map. It now remains to draw the required routes.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first line contains coordinates of Dr. Dee's house separated
with a space. The following lines contain the coordinates of St. Paul's
Cathedral, the National Gallery, and the British Museum in the same format. All
the coordinates are integers with absolute values not exceeding 10<sup>9</sup>.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Output</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Output the maximum length of the path that Dr. Dee and Matthew
Palmer's routes can have in common.
