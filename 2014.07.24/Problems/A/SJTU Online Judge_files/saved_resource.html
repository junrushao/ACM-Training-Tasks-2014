Titan Ruins: Hidden Entrance</h2><div class="problem_limits">Time limit: 1.0 second<br>Memory limit: 64 MB<br><br></div><div id="problem_text"><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Soren and Alba were famous and powerful wizards. They had been the founders of a magic guild that had united wizards of the Northern Territories and given them freedom and independence from the Southern Empire. Despite their venerable age, the friends still took an active part in all important events. When explorers of the Aspen Gorges found the remains of structures built by ancient Titans, who had created the world, Soren and Alba were among the first wizards to arrive to the place. They knew that Titans had been the most powerful wizards ever, and almost any study of their traces would give a strong impulse to the development of modern magic and would allow to understand the nature of magic on the whole.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">When Soren and Alba approached the Titan Ruins, they saw a blank wall standing out only a little bit against a rock. The wall was divided into small identical sections.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">`Where's the entrance?' Soren asked.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">`It's hidden, I suppose,' Alba said. `Did you think that Titans would open the gate for you? They were always very serious about their safety. But I'm sure there's a real door somewhere among these sections. As far as I remember, all Titans' structures that we know have a door, and its width is exactly three such sections.'</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">`That's good, but how can we find it? The wall is long, and the spell for dispersing such illusions requires much magic power. We can't apply the spell to the whole wall.'</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">`Yes, the Masking Spell affects the whole wall, but its force is nonuniform. I'm almost sure the spell is strongest exactly where the door is hidden. I have just activated the Magic Field Scanning Spell, and very soon we'll know the force of the field acting on each section.
We'll only have to choose three consecutive sections with maximum total force of the field and apply the Dispersal Spell to these sections.'</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first line contains the number <i>n</i> of sections in the wall (3 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 1000).
In the second line you are given <i>n</i> positive integers <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, which are the forces of the magic field acting on each section (1 ≤ <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Output</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Output two integers separated with a space. They should be the maximum total force of the field acting on three consecutive sections of the wall and the number of the middle section in this segment. It is guaranteed that there is only one answer.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Sample</h3><table class="sample"><tbody><tr><th width="350">input</th><th width="350">output</th></tr><tr><td><pre class="intable">6
