In this room, he saw a large platform with a lot of control sticks and a small coin lying on the platform.
Just for fun, Alba sent a weak charge of magic energy to the platform. Suddenly, instead of one coin, several coins appeared at the same place,
but soon they started to disappear one after another until only one coin remained. Alba sent one more charge, and several coins appeared again.
Another charge, and the number of coins decreased.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Continuing the experiments, Soren and Alba discovered the following rules.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal"><ul>
<li> The number of coins on the platform after sending a magic charge depends only on the number of coins that were on the platform before the charge was sent and is independent of the charge size and other factors.
</li><li> A charge may increase or decrease the number of coins, or the number of coins may stay the same. At any time there is at least one and at most <i>n</i> coins.
</li><li> If no charge is sent for some time, the coins disappear one by one until one coins remains on the platform.
This happens slowly, so that a new charge can be sent at any time—when there is any intermediate number of coins on the platform.
</li><li> The platform has <i>n</i> control sticks, and each control stick can be in one of <i>n</i> positions. If, at some moment, there are <i>i</i> coins on the platform and the <i>i</i>th stick is in position <i>j</i> (1 ≤ <i>j</i> ≤ <i>n</i>), then the number of coins on the platform after a charge has been sent becomes&nbsp;<i>j</i>.
</li></ul></div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Having examined the platform thoroughly, Soren found a small hidden door. It was locked, and he conjectured that the door could be opened if the control sticks were in certain positions. Since there were too many combinations of positions, the friends decided to try only those combinations for which the maximum number of <i>n</i> coins could be obtained from one coin. There had to be a smaller number of such combinations, but how many?</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">You are given the integer <i>n</i> (2 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 5000).</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Output</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Output the remainder in division by 10<sup>9</sup> + 7 of the number of positions of the control sticks that Soren and Alba should check.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Sample</h3><table class="sample"><tbody><tr><th width="350">input</th><th width="350">output</th></tr><tr><td><pre class="intable">2
