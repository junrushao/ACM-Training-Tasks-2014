Titan Ruins: Reconstruction of Bygones</h2><div class="problem_limits">Time limit: 1.0 second<br>Memory limit: 64 MB<br><br></div><div id="problem_text"><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">`It seems that we're in a trap,' said Soren.<br>
`A very familiar phrase,' Alba replied.<br></div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The friends were locked in a room, which, apparently, had been a sort of
laboratory where object copying experiments had been conducted. They decided so
because there were large piles of coins in the room and the coins in each pile were
identical to each other up to tiny scratches.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Soren studied the room and found a row of holes in one of the walls. The size
of each hole was equal to the size of a coin, and he conjectured that the door
would open when certain coins were put in the holes. At the same time, Alba
examined the book on the table and discovered in it a description of an
experiment with coins. In this experiment, coins were put one upon another
forming a stack. Sometimes the top coin was removed, and sometimes the Copying
Spell was applied, which produced an identical stack located on top of the
existing stack.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Soren and Alba decided to repeat the experiment, putting the coins removed from
the top of the stack into the holes one by one. They supposed that the door
would open after that. However, they didn't know the Copying Spell, so they had
to find out which coins were at top of stack without actual reproducing of all
experiment. There were lots of various coins in the room they could use, but
still it wasn't easy to choose which coins had to be put in the holes.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first line contains the number&nbsp;<i>n</i> of operations in the experiment (1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).
In each of the following <i>n</i> lines you are given an integer&nbsp;<i>x</i> (−1 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).
If <i>x</i> &gt; 0, then a coin of type <i>x</i> is put on top of the stack.
If <i>x</i> = −1, then the top coin is taken from the stack and put into the next hole in the wall.
If <i>x</i> = 0, then the stack is copied.
It is guaranteed that during the experiment each time a coin was to be removed the stack was not
empty.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Output</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Output the types of coins removed from the top of the stack in the course of the experiment.
