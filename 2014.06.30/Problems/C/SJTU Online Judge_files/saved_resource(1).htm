The <i>i</i>th friend bought <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> liters of juice. Then the friends came to Den and sat down to drink the juice.
Everybody, including Den, drank the same amount of juice.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">When there was no more juice, Misha started complaining about having bought more juice than he had drunk.
Den didn't want Misha to get upset, so he took one hundred roubles out of his pocket and gave the money to Misha
to compensate him for the juice he had bought but hadn't drunk himself. Then some more of Den's friends started
complaining about the same issue. Den had no more money, so he suggested that all the friends who had bought more juice
than they had drunk themselves should fairly divide his one hundred roubles between them. How should Den's friends
divide the money? Assume that Den paid not only for the juice he had drunk
but also for all the juice that had been drunk by the people who hadn't bought it.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first line contains the number <i>n</i> of Den's friends (2 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100).
