Each crossing in the streets is 
indentified with its vertical and horizontal street number. Some buildings in this city are so important that they need to be under 
surveillance by the police at all time. Since each building occupies an entire block of the streets, we can simply think of it as a 
cell of the grid. For an example, the black cells in Figure 1 represent important buildings. The building numbered 1 is located at a 
block surrounded by four crossings (3,7), (3,8), (4,7) and (4,8). 

<p>
The APD (ACM Police Department) decided to assign one police officer 
to each of the important buildings and let them keep watch of the buildings. The police officer must reside at one of the four crossings 
surrounding the building he is in charge of. For an example, the officer in charge of building 1 in Figure 1 has to reside at one of the 
four crossings (3,7), (3,8), (4,7), and (4,8). 

</p><p>
The officers should be able to communicate with each other. Since the chief of police was 
a huge fan of toys, he got rid of all walkie-talkies in the department, and instead forced the officers to use ``string phones". 
As you may know, a string phone is made of two paper cups (or, sometimes, two steel cans) linked by a string. For a string phone to 
work properly, the string should be kept tight. Since strings cannot pass though the buildings, they always run along the streets. 
Therefore, for two officers located at crossings <span class="MATH">(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>)</span> and <span class="MATH">(<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>)</span>, respectively, to be able to communicate, the length of the 
string phone they share must be equal to <!-- MATH
 $|x_1-�x_2|+|y_1-�y_2|$
 -->
<span class="MATH">| <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>| + | <i>y</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>|</span>, which is called <span class="textit">the shortest distance along the streets</span> between the 
two crossings.

Now, you have to help the officers to find their locations so that every string phone they have works properly. You are given the 
locations of <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> important buildings which are numbered from 1 through <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>. The buildings are apart from each other enough for no two 
buildings to have a crossing surrounding them in common. You are also given information about which couples of the officers share 
string phones and what the lengths of the strings are. This information is given as a form of weighted connected graph as depicted 
in Figure 2(a). Node <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>, <!-- MATH
 $i=1,2,\dots,n$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 1, 2,..., <i>n</i></span>, of the graph represents the officer who is in charge of building <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>. The existence of an edge 
<span class="MATH">(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>)</span> implies that two officers in charge of buildings <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>, respectively, share a string phone, and the weight of the edge represents 
the length of the string phone. This graph is always a connected graph. Your goal is to determine if it is possible to locate <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> officers 
so that every string phone works properly. Figure 2(b) shows an example of such locations for our example. In Figure 2(b), the small 
circles denote the crossings at which the officers are located. You can easily verify that the shortest distances along the streets 
between them are all met by the lengths of the string phones they have.
