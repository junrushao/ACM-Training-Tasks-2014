laptop computer or mobile phone. Since mobile devices prevail, it is getting serious to steal personal information by shoulder-surfing. 

<p>
Suppose that we have a smart phone. If we touch the screen keyboard directly to enter the password, this is very vulnerable since a 
shoulder-surfer easily knows what we have typed. So it is desirable to conceal the input information to discourage shoulder-surfers 
around us. Let me explain one way to do this. 

</p><p>
You are given a <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<span class="MATH">6 <tt>x</tt> 5</span> grid. Each column can be considered the visible part of a wheel. 
So you can easily rotate each column wheel independently to make password characters visible. In this problem, we assume that each 
wheel contains the 26 upper letters of English alphabet. See the following Figure 1.

<span class="MATH">6 <tt>x</tt> 5</span> window clips a valid grid representation for a password.

</div>
<p>
Assume that we have a length-5 password such as <!-- MATH
 $p_1 \ p_2 \ p_3 \ p_4 \ p_5$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>5</sub></span>. 
In order to pass the authentication procedure, we should construct a configuration of grid space where each <span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>i</sub></span> appears in the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th 
column of the grid. In that situation we say that the user password is accepted.

</p><p>
Let me start with one example. Suppose that our password was set `COMPU'. If we construct the grid as shown in Figure 2 on next page, 
then the authentication is successfully processed.

</p><div align="CENTER">Figure 2. A valid grid representation for password `COMPU'. 

</div>
<p>
In this password system, the position of each password character in each 
column is meaningless. If each of the 5 characters in <!-- MATH
 $p_1 \ p_2 \ p_3 \ p_4 \ p_5$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>4</sub>&nbsp;<i>p</i><sub>5</sub></span> appears in the corresponding column, that can be 
considered the 
correct password. So there are many grid configurations allowing one password. Note that the sequence of letters on each wheel is 
randomly determined for each trial and for each column. In practice, the user is able to rotate each column and press ``Enter" 
key, so a should-surfer cannot perceive the password by observing the <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<span class="MATH">6 <tt>x</tt> 5</span> grid since there are too many password candidates. 
In this <!-- MATH
 $6 \times 5$
 -->
<span class="MATH">6 <tt>x</tt> 5</span> grid space, maximally <!-- MATH
 $6^5 =7,776$
 -->
<span class="MATH">6<sup>5</sup> = 7, 776</span> cases are possible. This is the basic idea of the proposed password system against 
shoulder-surfers. 

</p><p>
Unfortunately there is a problem. If a shoulder-surfer can observe more than two grid plate configurations 
for a person, then the shoulder-surfer can reduce the searching space and guess the correct password. Even though it is not easy to 
stealthily observe other's more than once, this is one weakness of implicit grid passwords. 

</p><p>
Let me show one example with two 
observed configurations for a grid password. The user password is `COMPU', but `DPMAG' is also one candidate password derived 
from the following configuration.

You are given two configurations of grid password from a shoulder-surfer. Suppose that you have succeeded to stealthily record snapshots 
of the target person's device (e.g. smart phone). Then your next task is to reconstruct all possible passwords from these two snapshots. 
Since there are lots of password candidates, you are asked for the <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>-th password among all candidates in lexicographical order. In Figure 3, 
let us show the first 5 valid password. The first 5 valid passwords are `ABGAG' , `ABGAS', `ABGAU', `ABGPG' and `ABGPS'. 

</p><p>
The number <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is given in each test case differently. If there does not exist a <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>-th password since k is larger than the number of all 
possible 
passwords, then you should print `<tt>NO</tt>' in the output.

Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> test cases. The number of test cases <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> is given in the first 
line of the input. The first line of each test case contains one integer, <span class="MATH"><i>K</i></span>, the order of the password you should find. Note that
