Drop7 is a single-player game played on a <!-- MATH
 $7 \times 7$
 -->
<span class="MATH">7 <tt>x</tt> 7</span> vertical grid. 
Initially, the grid is empty. In each turn, you will be given a 
disc on which a number between 1 and 7 is written and you have to 
drop it into one of the 7 column from the above. It falls down the <span class="MATH">7</span>-th 
row of the selected column, until it reaches above an already occupied 
cell or touches the ground in the first (bottom) row. For example, in 
Figure 1, dropping the disc into the first (leftmost) column causes it 
to stand in the second row (avobe 6) and dropping it into the third column causes
it to hit the ground and to stay in the first row.

After dropping the given disc in a turn, each disc having a number equal 
to the size of its group-row or group-column will disappear (we will 
shortly define group-row a group-column). We know that all the discs 
that are subject to disappear will fade simultaneously. After that, all 
discs that the disc below them has been disappeared will fall down as 
far as possible. Then, the disappearance condition will be checked 
again on all the available discs again and if some disc number matches 
their group-row/column size, the loop continues. Otherwise, the next 
turn comes and a new disc will be dropped. 

</p><p>

The group-column of a disc is the number of discs that are already placed 
in the same column, including itself. For example, if we drop the 
disc 3 into the first column (as in Figure 1), its group-colum will have 
the size of 2 and nothing happens. But, if we drop it into the <span class="MATH">4</span>-th 
column from the left, the disc will disappear (because the group-column 
consists of three of discs, 7, 7, and 3). Interestingly, if we drop 
this disc over the <span class="MATH">7</span>-th (rightmost) column, not only the disc itself will 
disappear, but also the other 3 will disappear at the same time! 
More interestingly, if we drop this disc on the <span class="MATH">2</span>-nd column, two discs 
will be removed in two steps - first the disc 4 will disappear as the 
column size (after putting 3 over it) will be 4. Then, after removal 
of 4, disc 3 will fall down over the two fives and then disappears by 
the same rule of matching number with group-column size. 

</p><p>
Group-row size of a disc, however, is the number of discs connectedly in
the same row of the disc. For example, in Figure 2, if we drop disc 1 into 
the second column, the group-row size of it, besides the 5 in the 
first column, would be two. But if we drop it into the last column, 
the group-row size of both of 3's will become 3 and they both will disappear 
at the same time. Then the disc 1 will have group-row size of 1 and will 
disappear by itself!

Starting with an empty board, you will be given some disc-drop actions. 
You just have to simulate the game and write down the final state of the 
board in the output.

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a 
line containing the number <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> <!-- MATH

 -->

discs dropped. In the following next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines, <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> pairs of <!-- MATH

 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>v</i><sub>i</sub>&nbsp;<i>c</i><sub>i</sub></span> will be 
given, which states that a turn <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>, a disc with number <span class="MATH"><i>v</i><sub>i</sub></span> is dropped into 
the column <span class="MATH"><i>c</i><sub>i</sub></span>. It is guaranteed that <!-- MATH

<p>
For each test case of the input, write seven lines of length seven, 
indicating the disc numbers in the grid. Put a hash sign (<code>#</code>) for empty 
cells. See the sample output for clarification. If during the game, a 
disc is dropped into a column that already contains 7 discs, just 
write ``<tt>Game Over!</tt>" for the output of the test case. Write a blank 
line after the output of each test case.
