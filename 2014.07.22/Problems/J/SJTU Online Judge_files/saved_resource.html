Flatland is a 2-dimensional world in which some creatures have an 
odd miserable life. Despite the many handicaps, the poor creatures 
have recently achieved the wireless technology in Flatland. So, the 
priest circles (governors of Flatland who kill the apostles of 3D 
as soon as they see one) created the national motto ``<span class="textit">Wireless 
technology is our indisputable right!</span>" and organized a wireless  
spreading committee for connecting all important points of the 
Flatland by wireless antennas.

Everything went well until the committee reached the mountainous 
region of Flatland. This region can be modeled with a horizontal 
<span class="textit">base line</span> covered by a contiguous serie of mountain. Each mountain 
is a right-angled isosceles triangle with its base on the 
<span class="textit">base line</span> and its right angle as the peak. Currently, there 
are only two types of mountains in this region: those with a height 
of 50, and those with a height of 100. You can see a sample of the 
mountainous region in the figure below. 

</p><p>
The wireless spreading comitte first installed their antennas on the 
points they had already planned for the mountainous region. But in 
the end, they found out that a pair of antennas could directly 
communicate only if the line segment connecting the two antennas had no 
crossing intersection with any obstacles -- specifically the mountains 
here. Note that two antennas <span class="textit">can</span> communicate if
<span class="textit">only the border</span> of obstacles is on their connecting line 
segment. 

</p><p>
Since removing a wireless antenna in Flatland is nowadays as a deadly 
sin as ``chromatization'', the only way to connect the set of already 
installed antennas is to install some extra antennas on the appropriate 
points of the mountains! Wireless antennas can generally relay the 
messages and connect to ones which cannot communicate directly. In 
order to reduce the expenses of installing extra antennas, the 
wireless spreading committee has hired you to find the minimum number 
of antennas needed to install. 

</p><p>
For example, consider the 4 diamond-shaped points in the figure below 
as the place of the wireless antennas already installed on the 
mountains. Now the whole set becomes connected if you instal 3 new 
antennas in the places specified by the circle-shaped points.

There are multiple test cases in the input. Each test case starts

<!-- MATH
 $h_{1}, h_{2} , \dots, h_{n}$

<span class="MATH"><i>h</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>h</i><sub>n</sub></span> <!-- MATH

<span class="MATH">(<i>h</i><sub>i</sub> <img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \in$" border="0" height="31" src="5055img4.png" width="16"> {50, 100})</span>, respectively 
representing the height of the mountains on the <span class="textit">base line</span> from left to right. 
The third (last) line of the test case contains <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> integers 
specifying the position of the antennas already installed on the 
mountains. The position of each antenna is specified by its X 
coordinate, assuming the left-most point of the left-most mountain 
being the origin of the coordinate system. You yourself can calculate 
the Y coordinate of antenna as it is put on the boundaries of a 
mountain. 

</p><p>
The input terminates with a line of the form ``<tt>0 0</tt>" which should 
not be processed as a test case.
