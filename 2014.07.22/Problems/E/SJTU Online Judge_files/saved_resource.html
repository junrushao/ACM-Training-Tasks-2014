Pasha is a passenger in Rome, Italy. He is in the train station 
terminal right now (named <span class="textit">Stazinione Termini</span> in Italian) 
and wants to go to the airport of Rome (named <span class="textit">Aeroporto 
Fiumicino</span>) as soon as possible.

<p>
Just in front of the exit door of Termini, he found a bus station 
for Bus Shuttle service which takes the passengers right to airport 
for only 8 Euros per passenger, luggage included! ``Sounds economic 
an fast!", said Pasha with himself and decided to wait for the bus. 

</p><p>
Under the sign for Bus Shuttle, there was a time table in which only 
leaving time of buses was written. As it is around 7:00 AM in Rome now, 
he has to wait until 7:45 AM for the first bus to come. 

</p><p>
Pasha is curious to know the travel time between <span class="textit">Stazione 
Termini</span> and <span class="textit">Aeroporto Fiumicino</span>. He asks some passengers in 
the bus station but they don't know it or their English are too weak 
to talk to Pasha! However, a passenger tells Pasha: 

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
''I Remember, it was yesterday at 13:15, that I was in a bus shuttle 
to <span class="textit">Termini</span> and saw another bus shuttle (going to 
<span class="textit">Aeroporto</span>) just passed us, in the opposite direction. But, 
I can't remember when I got sit in the bus and when we arrived 
to <span class="textit">Aeroporto</span>. All I remember is a cross with another shuttle 
at 13:15". 

</blockquote>
<p>
Not enough information, but still useful. A few minutes later, some 
other passengers gave the same type of information to Pasha - exactly 
a meet at a certain time with a shuttle bus coming in opposite 
direction while they were in a bus. 

</p><p>
And finally Pasha found a brochure of the shuttle service, in which 
not only the time table of ``Termini to Aeroporto" was written, but 
also the time table of ``Aeroporto to Termini" could be found (i.e. 
the same table in the figure, but in the Aeroport station and for 
buses that are leaving Aeroporto to Termini). 

</p><p>
Having these two time tables and some meeting-time (like 13:15 in 
above example), Pasha asks for your assistance to discover the travel 
time between Termini and Aeroporto, in minutes. 

</p><p>
You may assume that all buses are moving with constant speed and 
without stop in the middle of the way. We know that the travel time 
is less than 24 hours. You can also assume each bus goes to parking 
after arriving to its destination and all the buses are leaving in 
a single day i.e. if there are <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> leaving times written on Termini 
station and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> leaving times are on Aeroporto station, then assume 
only <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> + <i>m</i></span> buses exist in Rome, which have <!-- MATH
 $n \times m$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>m</i></span> possible 
meeting times.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a 
line containing two numbers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> (the number of buses going from Termini 
to Aeroporto) and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> (the number of buses going from Aeroporto to 
Termini) in the day of our story. It is guaranteed that 
<!-- MATH
 $0 < n, m \le 100$
 -->
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>n</i>, <i>m</i><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5050img2.png" width="18">100</span>. 

</p><p>
In the second line of each test case, <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> distinct and space-separated 
times are given between 00:00 and 23:59 (inclusive) with leading zero 
when minutes or hours are single digit. They are the times a buses 
leaves Termini to Aeroporto. The third line contains <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> distinct 
times, in the same format, for the buses leaving Aeroporto to Termini. 
You can assume either all of these <span class="MATH"><i>m</i> + <i>n</i></span> times are even, or all of 
them are odd (in minutes). 

</p><p>
The fourth line contains an integer <!-- MATH
 $1 \le k \le 100$
 -->
<span class="MATH">1<img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5050img2.png" width="18"><i>k</i><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5050img2.png" width="18">100</span>, the number of 
passengers who have given ``meeting time while was in the bus" to 
Pasha. These <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> times are written in the fifth line in the same format 
for time as above and separated by space. 

</p><p>
</p><p>
<br>
<span class="textbf">Hint:</span>
</p><p>
Althoug all buses a 
leaving in the same day but they may meet the day after! For example, 
if the travel time is 8 hours, then a bus leaving at 22:00 from A to T 
will meet the bus leaving at 23:00 from T to A at 06:30 next day. 
This way, a report of 06:30 may belong the morning of the same day 
(e.g. a bus left at 05:00 met the bus left at 06:00 of opposite 
direction and the travel time is 2 hours, or the prior case). Remember 
that a meet can occur even in stations! 

</p><p>
For example, a bus may leave at 21:05 and another bus from the 
opposite direction arrives exactly at the same time. The last 
line of the input contains two zero numbers.

</p><h2><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>
For each test case, if the travel time can be found and is unique, 
write it in a single line. If no travel time can satisfy the claims 
of the passengers write ``<tt>il bugiardo passeggeri!</tt>" (without 
quotes) for this case and proceed to the the next line. Otherwise, 
if there are <span class="MATH"><i>c</i> &gt; 1</span> possible travel times (in range 00:01 to 
23:59, of course) write ``<span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> <tt>scelte</tt>" where <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> is substituted 
with its value. Note that the travel times cannot have 
fractions of minutes.
