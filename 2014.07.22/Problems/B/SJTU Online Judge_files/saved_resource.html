Finally, the budget for enhancing Arbiter web site (which is an online 
judge) is allocated and your job is to improve the functionality of its 
login page. The new login page should help users on two common login 
mistakes: 

</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>When the ``caps lock" key is ON, each lowercase letter is typed as 
uppercase and vice versa. 
</li>
<li>When ``num lock" key is OFF, numeric characters (digits `0' through `9') 
are not typed. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Given a username and a password in the login page, the system compares 
the entered password with the original one (for that username). If 
they were the same, the login step is successfully finished and the 
user is redirected to the appropriate page. Otherwise, the login is 
unsuccessful. But, some extra hints should be given to the user if the 
entered password was related to the original one in the following ways: 

</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>If the two passwords were case-insensitively the same, but the case 
of all their English letters were completely opposite, then the ``caps 
lock" key might be ON by mistake. 
</li>
<li>If the entered password was the same as the original one after 
removing the numeric characters of the original password, then the 
``num lock" key might be OFF by mistake 
</li>
<li>The two cases above might happen together. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Given both the entered password and its original one, you have to write 
a program which prints the appropriate message.

</p><p>
</p><h2><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>
The input contains <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> test cases. The fist line of input has only the 
integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>. Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines is a test case having two strings 
of at least one and at most 10 alphanumeric characters. The first 
string is the original password, and the second one is the password 
entered by the user in the login page.

</p><p>
</p><h2><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>
Write the result of the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th test case, on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th line of output. As you 
see in the sample output you should write the test case number and then, 
one of the following messages: 

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>Login successful.</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>Wrong password. Please, check your caps lock key.</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>Wrong password. Please, check your num lock key.</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>Wrong password. Please, check your caps lock and num lock keys.</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>Wrong password.</tt>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
<br>
Note that you must write the output exactly as indicates. Pay attention 
to character cases and blanks.
