Every four years, the world is enthusiastically celebrating the 
Football World Cup event. Hosting such a prestigious event is 
an honor for a country whichpours in billions of dollars. That is 
why there are many competitions among volunteer countries and even 
some shadow-bribing to get the vote to be the host of the World Cup. 

</p><p>
Voting procedure in the selection ceremony is yet another important 
part of the host. Several countries <!-- MATH
 $\{C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots, C_{n}\}$
 -->
<span class="MATH">{<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>C</i><sub>n</sub>}</span> stand as the 
candidates fo the host. Repeatedly, two countries are selected 
randomly, and are put to vote. The losing country is eliminated and 
the process is continued untill only one country remains which is 
the winner. 

</p><p>
We have run a poll beforehand to predict the possible outcome of the 
voting. For a pairs of countries <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>i</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>j</sub></span>, we know which one 
is the winner if the two countries are put in vote against each other. 
There is no possibility of ties in the voting. 

</p><p>
The problem is, having the result of polls, determine the set of
countries for which there is a possibility to win. In other words, 
rule out the countries for which we are sure there is no chance of 
becoming the host.

<p>
There are several test cases in the input. The first line of each 
test case contains a single intger <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> <!-- MATH

 -->
<span class="MATH">(0 &lt; <i>n</i><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5053img1.png" width="18">1000)</span>, the 
number of countries. Then there are <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines, describing the poll 
results. The <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th line <!-- MATH

<span class="MATH">(1<img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5053img1.png" width="18"><i>i</i><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \le$" border="0" height="31" src="5053img1.png" width="18"><i>n</i>)</span> is a string of zeros and 
ones of lengt <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - <i>i</i></span>. The <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>-th character in the string is one 
if <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>i</sub></span> wins over <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>j</sub></span>, and zero otherwise Note that the last line 
of each test case is an empty line. The last line of the input contains 
a single `<tt>0</tt>'.
